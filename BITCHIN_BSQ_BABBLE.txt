STEP 1: READ THE MAP INTO OUR PROGRAM

	- Get the information required to read the map from the first line.
		- The number of lines
		- The empty character
		- The obstacle character
		- The full character
	
	- Find the start of the map, and convert the map into a useable form (probably a 2d char array)
		- Depending on the formatting of the map, and if newline is used, will need to parse it and ensure
		  that the line numbers are used to create the proper size and shape array.

	Functions Required:
	
	- get_legend - Some kind of ATOI-like function, but to grab specifically the map "legend" information.
	- get_map - Another function to find the start and end of the map itself and read it into an array.
	- check_map - Ensure that each map is valid according to the rules. If not valid, save an error state to be 
				  printed and move on to the next map.
	- check_args - Ensure that the command line input is valid.


	STEP 2: RUN SOLVING ALGORITHM

	- 

	STEP ?: PRINT ALL SOLUTIONS TO THE TERMINAL

		- Print the solution found for each map to the terminal, followed by a newline.
		- If there was a map error, display "map error" ON THE ERROR OUTPUT, followed by a newline.
		- Move on to next map after succesful print, or map error.




	STEP ?: FREE ALL MEMORY BEFORE EXITING
